## Books I Worked Through and Can Recommend:
### The QC-"Bible" by Isaac L. Chuang & Michael Nielsen
[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Isaac-L-Chuang-Michael-Nielsen/dp/1107002176)

### Applied Quantum Computing by Jack D. Hidary
An amazing book for anyone trying to get things started. Especially the sections on mathematical tools at the end of the book have really proven useful.
Linear Algebra rocks!
